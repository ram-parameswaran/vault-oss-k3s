## Architecture

Details of how the repo functions go here

## Prerequisites

- [Multipass](https://multipass.run/)

- [Git, or any other Git client](https://git-scm.com/)

- It also doesn't hurt to have [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) installed on your host machine, though the Linux VM bootstraps with it installed and aliased to `k` so it's not really necessary.

## Getting started

#### From your host machine

`multipass launch -n <vm name> -m 4G -c 2 -d 10GB --cloud-init cloud-init/packages.yaml`

`multipass shell <nm name>`

#### From the VM


## Cleanup

Cleanup steps here

`multipass delete <vm name>`

`multipass purge`

## Notes


## Troubleshooting

#### Multipass not deleting machine after delete & purge

`multipass stop`
`multipass list`
`multipass delete <vm name> --purge`
`multipass list`
